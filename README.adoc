== Example catalog

[IMPORTANT]
.Prepare
====
Please read link:UsageType.adoc[Usage Type] first.

And select one way to install something.
====

You can treat each project as a distinct module. Refer to the README file in each individual project to learn how to run it.

 $ cd xxxx
 $ ./gradlew clean asciidoctor

You can find the resulting pdf files in the build/docs/asciidocPdf directory of each project.

[WARNING]
.WARNING
====
Alternatively, you can optionally run all of examples at once using the following command from the repository root:

 $ ./gradlew clean asciidoctor
 
While you can do this, I don't recommend it.

Because it takes a long time to execute all at once.

In addition, some projects need to be installed according to specific types. See link:UsageType.adoc[Usage Type].

Build processing will fail if certain types of packages are not pre-installed.

=== Shared Adoc files example

pdf-cjk-ext-adocs-examples::
Cantains asciidoc (.adoc) files, image files. This project is only used to share asciidoc (.adoc) files, image files inside.


=== All in one example
asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-ext-examples-all-in-one::
Combine all examples in one project include adoc files. Independent of the asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-ext-gradle-examples project.

Its `build.gradle` file has a lot of comments that can make it difficult to read and understand.

So I divided this project into multiple projects, set them for different usage types, and removed all irrelevant annotations in `build.gradle`.

Mainly divided into use-file, use-jar, use-maven-repo And use asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-ext theme or use custome theme.

Custome theme is extends asciidoctor-pdf-cjk-ext theme.
